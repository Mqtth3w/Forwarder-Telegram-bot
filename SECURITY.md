# Security Policy

> [!IMPORTANT]
> ## Good privacy practices
> To protect your privacy you could use a [duck address](https://duckduckgo.com/duckduckgo-help-pages/email-protection/duck-addresses/) for the registration. A duck address should be binded to a privacy focused email (e.g. [tutamail](https://tuta.com/)).
> 
> ## Security guidelines
> 
> - Never share your bot api key.
> - Never Share your secret token.
> - Never share your Cloudflare worker url. If someone know your worker url can impersonate you with fake requests to the worker (they should also know your secret token or brute force it), because your Telegram ID is not secret. If your worker url is not secret change it!
>
> ## Attention!
> Please note: Cloudflare hosts your service so they could be able to see all your data. To stay really secure and anonym you should host it by yourself.

> [!TIP]
> ## Certificate
> 
> Optionally, you can set up a self-signed certificate to enhance the security of requests. 
> For more datails check the following links: [setWebhook](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#setwebhook) and [self-signed](https://core.telegram.org/bots/self-signed).
